 Copies the user current clipboard and converts it to a Word file. Current version ONLY works for windows systems. 
It has been confirmed that it does not work on Macs.

Setup:

2. Install python and remember to check the add path. 
3. Type in a new path. Path for where the word file is to be stored.
